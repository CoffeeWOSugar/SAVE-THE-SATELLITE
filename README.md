# SAVE THE SATELLITE 
###### AUTHOR Vincent Andersson
This project aims to create a fun and educational environment to interact with a few coding concepts within predefined scenarios.

Keep in mind this is still very early development

#### Scenario 1 - Software Bugs
###### Scenario:
Simulate debugging and patching software in real-time to correct a navigational error or data handling issue.

###### Gameplay Mechanics:
Players could be presented with simplified "code" puzzles or logic problems representing the bug. Solving these under time constraints simulates the pressure of fixing critical software issues on an operational satellite.

###### Educational Aspect:
Introduces players to the concept of software reliability in space missions and the importance of precise calculations and coding standards (like the Mars Climate Orbiter metric/imperial mix-up).


#### Scenario 2 - Battery Issues
###### Scenario:
Simulate managing power resources after a battery failure, requiring players to prioritize systems for power distribution and perhaps find a way to restore full power capacity.

###### Gameplay Mechanics:
Players must manage a limited power budget, deciding which systems to keep operational and which to temporarily shut down to conserve energy. Challenges can escalate with unexpected demands on the satellite's power system.

###### Educational Aspect:
Teaches about power management in satellite operations and the critical role of power systems in maintaining mission functionality.
