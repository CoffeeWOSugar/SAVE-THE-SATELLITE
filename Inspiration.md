Proof of Concept
Scenario 1 - Software Bugs
Scenario: Simulate debugging and patching software in real-time to correct a navigational error or data handling issue.

Gameplay Mechanics: Players could be presented with simplified "code" puzzles or logic problems representing the bug. Solving these under time constraints simulates the pressure of fixing critical software issues on an operational satellite.

Educational Aspect: Introduces players to the concept of software reliability in space missions and the importance of precise calculations and coding standards (like the Mars Climate Orbiter metric/imperial mix-up).


Scenario 2 - Battery Issues
Scenario: Simulate managing power resources after a battery failure, requiring players to prioritize systems for power distribution and perhaps find a way to restore full power capacity.

Gameplay Mechanics: Players must manage a limited power budget, deciding which systems to keep operational and which to temporarily shut down to conserve energy. Challenges can escalate with unexpected demands on the satellite's power system.

Educational Aspect: Teaches about power management in satellite operations and the critical role of power systems in maintaining mission functionality.



List of incidents as inspiration:

1. Solar Panel Failure
Skylab (1973): America's first space station suffered damage during launch, resulting in one of its solar panels tearing off and another being unable to deploy, severely affecting power generation.
2. Battery Issues
Hubble Space Telescope (2008): Experienced a problem with one of its data handling units due to battery failure, requiring a Space Shuttle mission to repair.
3. Gyroscope Failures
Kepler Space Telescope (2013): Lost the use of two of its four gyroscopes, which were crucial for pointing the telescope. The mission was redefined to continue observations in a limited capacity.
4. Collision Threats and Debris
Iridium 33 and Kosmos-2251 (2009): A commercial Iridium communications satellite collided with a defunct Russian satellite, generating thousands of pieces of space debris.
Fengyun-1C Anti-Satellite Missile Test (2007): China tested an anti-satellite missile by destroying one of its own weather satellites, creating a large field of space debris.
5. Onboard Computer Failures
Galileo Spacecraft (1991): Experienced multiple tape recorder malfunctions and software issues throughout its mission to Jupiter, affecting data storage and transmission.
6. Antenna Problems
Galaxy 15 (2010): Known as the "zombie satellite," it failed to respond to commands while still broadcasting, leading to potential interference with other satellites' signals.
7. Thermal Control Issues
NOAA-19 (2009): Before its launch, this weather satellite was damaged when it fell to the floor due to improper handling, impacting its thermal control system.
8. Software Bugs
Mars Climate Orbiter (1999): A navigational error caused by a mix-up between metric and imperial units led to the orbiter burning up in Mars' atmosphere.
9. Propulsion System Malfunctions
AEHF-1 (2010): A military communications satellite that experienced a propulsion system failure, requiring an extended period to reach its designated orbit.
10. Power Systems Failure
Telstar 401 (1997): A popular communications satellite that suffered a complete failure, possibly due to a space weather event causing damage to its power system.
